Backend Project file structure - Express / Node JS
---

1] app.js:- This file starts your web server. All your set up logic should be in this file.

2] Controllers:- This folder contains all the business logic of your application. There should be a file for each type of control. e.g. If you want to perform operations on users there should be UserController.js file. If you want analytics there should be AnalyticsController.js.

3] Models:- All the database models should go into the models folder. Again you should write each model into its own file. e.g. User model in UserModel.js.

4] Public:- All the public files such as images, javascript files, CSS files should go into this folder. You should divide your files into their own folder.

5] Routes:- All your routing-related logic should go into this folder. Again divide this logic into multiple files based on functionality. i.e For homepage routing functionality should go into index.js.

6] Views:- So this folder contains all your views i.e. HTML/ejs files. Drop this folder if you are building rest APIâ€™s.

7] config.js:- This file should contain all your configuration e.g. PORT number, secrets, keys etc. Do not commit this file to Git.
